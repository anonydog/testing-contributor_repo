Contributor repo
====
A fake contributor repo that we use for automatic testing

This is supposed to mimic a github fork created by some contributor
that wants to propose changes. This is the repo that _sendsi_ pull requests
to `testing-maintainer_repo`

This README is just a placeholder. You can find the real fork is at the
`upstream` branch
